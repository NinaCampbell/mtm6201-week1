        <p>My name is Nina Campbell, I am a first year student in the IMD Program. I have been practicing digital art for roughly 7 years and while I often take breaks that may last for months at a time, it has always been my passion. Rather than taking a program in character design or animation however, I chose Interactive Media Design to pursue new passions like video and to keep my art as a simple hobby rather than a career. It has always been my life goal to work toward a career I know I will enjoy, therefore in the future, I hope to find a career in video production/editing.</p>
